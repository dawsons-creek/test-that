# Test That: Modern Python Testing Framework

**A developer-first testing framework that delivers crystal-clear failure diagnostics and precise test targeting.**

Test That transforms the testing experience by eliminating guesswork from test failures. When tests break, you get immediate, actionable insights with side-by-side expected vs actual comparisons. Combined with flexible test targeting and an intuitive fluent API, Test That accelerates debugging workflows and reduces time-to-fix.

## Why Test That?

- **Crystal Clear Failures**: No more parsing cryptic assertion errors - see exactly what went wrong
- **Precise Test Targeting**: Run specific tests by line number, pattern, or suite for efficient debugging  
- **Intelligent Test Organization**: Suite-based organization with automatic setup/teardown and dependency injection
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for custom assertions, time control, and HTTP recording
- **Rich Output**: Color-coded results with timing, stack traces, and focused failure modes

## Installation

This package is available on GitHub only (not published to PyPI):

```bash
# Install from GitHub
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/dawsons-creek/test-that.git

# Or with uv
uv add git+ssh://git@github.com/dawsons-creek/test-that.git

# For development
git clone git@github.com:dawsons-creek/test-that.git
cd test-that
uv sync
```

## Quick Start

Write tests that read like documentation:

```python
from test_that import test, suite, that

@test("validates user email format")
def test_email_validation():
    user = User(email="invalid-email")
    that(user.is_valid()).equals(True)
    that(user.errors).is_empty()

@test("calculates order total with tax")  
def test_order_total():
    order = Order(items=[Item(price=100), Item(price=50)])
    that(order.total_with_tax(0.08)).equals(162.0)
```

**Crystal clear failures when things go wrong:**
```
âœ— validates user email format

  that(user.is_valid()).equals(True)
  
  Expected: True
  Actual:   False
  
  Additional context:
  user.errors = ['Invalid email format: invalid-email']
```

No more digging through stack traces or print statements to understand test failures.

## Running Tests

Multiple CLI commands are available for convenience:

```bash
# Run all tests (any of these work)
test_that
that  
tt

# Run specific test file
tt tests/test_user.py

# Run test at specific line number
tt tests/test_user.py:42

# Run tests in line range  
tt tests/test_user.py:20-50

# Run multiple line numbers
tt tests/test_user.py:15,30,45

# Run specific suite
tt -s "User Management"

# Run tests matching pattern
tt -k "validation"

# Verbose mode (includes stack traces)
tt -v

# Disable colors
tt --no-color
```

## Core Features

### Intuitive Test Organization

Organize tests naturally with descriptive names and logical grouping:

```python
from test_that import suite, test, that

with suite("User Authentication"):
    @test("authenticates valid user credentials")
    def test_valid_login():
        user = authenticate("john@example.com", "secure_password")
        that(user.is_authenticated).is_true()
        that(user.role).equals("user")
    
    @test("rejects invalid credentials")
    def test_invalid_login():
        that(lambda: authenticate("bad@email.com", "wrong")).raises(AuthenticationError)
```

### Rich Assertion Library

Expressive assertions that read like natural language:

```python
# Collections and strings
that(users).has_length(5)
that(email).contains("@").and_starts_with("user")
that(response.status_code).is_between(200, 299)

# Objects and types  
that(user).is_instance_of(User)
that(user.created_at).is_not_none()

# Advanced assertions
that(api_call).raises(ValidationError).with_message("Invalid input")
that(slow_function).completes_within(seconds=2)
```

### Powerful Test Fixtures

Clean, predictable test environments with automatic resource management:

```python
with suite("Payment Processing"):
    def setup():
        """Initialize test environment - return value passed to all tests"""
        db = create_test_database()
        mock_payment_gateway = MockStripeAPI()
        return TestContext(db=db, gateway=mock_payment_gateway)
    
    def teardown(context):
        """Automatic cleanup after each test"""
        context.db.rollback()
        context.gateway.reset()
    
    @test("processes successful payment")
    def test_payment_success(context=setup):
        payment = process_payment(context.gateway, amount=100.0)
        that(payment.status).equals("completed")
        that(payment.transaction_id).is_not_none()
```

### Advanced Testing Capabilities

```python
from test_that import mock, replay

# Time control for deterministic testing
@replay.time("2024-01-15T10:00:00Z")
@test("creates order with correct timestamp")
def test_order_timestamp():
    order = create_order()
    that(order.created_at).equals(datetime(2024, 1, 15, 10, 0, 0))

# Intelligent mocking
@test("handles API failures gracefully")
def test_api_failure():
    with mock.patch('requests.get') as mock_get:
        mock_get.side_effect = ConnectionError("Network timeout")
        result = fetch_user_data(user_id=123)
        that(result.error).equals("Service temporarily unavailable")
```

## Precise Test Targeting

Test That supports flexible test execution with granular control:

### Line Number Targeting
```bash
# Note: Line number targeting is currently being fixed in the CLI
# The feature exists but has an argument parsing issue

# Run test at specific line
tt tests/test_user.py:42

# Run tests in a range 
tt tests/test_user.py:20-50

# Run multiple specific lines
tt tests/test_user.py:15,30,45
```

### Pattern Matching
```bash
# Run tests with names containing "validation"
tt -k "validation"

# Run specific test suite
tt -s "User Management"

# Combine file and pattern
tt tests/test_user.py -k "email"
```

This makes debugging and development much faster by running only the tests you're working on.

## Assertion API

### Equality
```python
that(value).equals(expected)
that(value).does_not_equal(expected)
```

### Truthiness
```python
that(value).is_true()
that(value).is_false()
that(value).is_none()
that(value).is_not_none()
```

### Collections
```python
that(collection).contains(item)
that(collection).does_not_contain(item)
that(collection).is_empty()
that(collection).has_length(n)
```

### Strings
```python
that(string).matches(regex_pattern)
that(string).starts_with(prefix)
that(string).ends_with(suffix)
```

### Numbers
```python
that(number).is_greater_than(n)
that(number).is_less_than(n)
that(number).is_between(min, max)
```

### Types
```python
that(value).is_instance_of(Type)
that(value).has_type(Type)
```

### Exceptions
```python
that(callable).raises(ExceptionType)
that(callable).does_not_raise()
```

## Configuration

Optional `pyproject.toml` configuration:

```toml
[tool.that]
test_dir = "tests"        # Directory to search for tests
pattern = "test_*.py"     # Pattern for test files
verbose = false           # Verbose output by default
color = true              # Colored output (auto-detected)
```

## Development

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management.

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run that

# Run tests with verbose output
uv run that -v

# Run specific test file
uv run that tests/test_example.py
```
